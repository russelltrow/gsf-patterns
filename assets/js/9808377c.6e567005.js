However, most applications run without taking this into consideration, resulting in underused and inefficient resources. Scaling infrastructure dynamically based on actual demand eliminates excess capacity and improves efficiency.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/operations/dynamic-scaling-based-on-demand"},{"id":"catalog/architecture/evaluate-energy-efficient-processors","title":"Evaluate and adopt energy-efficient processor architectures","description":"Applications are built with a software architecture that best fits the business need they are serving. Cloud providers make it easy to evaluate different CPU architectures, including energy-efficient cloud-native processors that offer good performance per watt.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/evaluate-energy-efficient-processors"},{"id":"catalog/architecture/implement-stateless-design","title":"Implement stateless design","description":"Service state refers to the in-memory or on-disk data required by a service to function. State includes the data structures and member variables that the service reads and writes. Depending on how the service is architected, the state might also include files or other resources stored on the disk. Applications that consume large memory or on-disk data require larger VM sizes, especially for cloud computing where you would need larger VM SKUs to support high RAM capacity and multiple data disks.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/implement-stateless-design"},{"id":"catalog/development/minimize-transmitted-data","title":"Minimize transmitted data size","description":"From an energy-efficiency perspective, it\'s better to minimize the size of the data transmitted so that less energy is required because the network traffic is reduced.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/development/minimize-transmitted-data"},{"id":"catalog/operations/optimise-storage-resource-utilisation","title":"Optimise storage utilization","description":"It\'s better to maximise storage utilisation so the storage layer is optimised for the task, not only in terms of energy proportionality but also in terms of embodied carbon. Two storage units running at low utilization rates will consume more energy than one running at a high utilization rate. In addition, the unused capacity on the underutilised storage unit could be more efficiently used for another task or process.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/operations/optimise-storage-resource-utilisation"},{"id":"catalog/operations/optimize-cpu-utilization","title":"Optimize CPU utilization","description":"CPU usage and utilization varies throughout the day, sometimes wildly for different computational requirements. The larger the variance between the average and peak CPU utilization values, the more resources need to be provisioned in stand-by mode to absorb those spikes in traffic.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/operations/optimize-cpu-utilization"},{"id":"catalog/architecture/compress-ml-models-for-inference","title":"Optimize the size of AI/ML models","description":"Large-scale AI/ML models require significant storage space and take more resources to run as compared to optimized models. Modern model optimization techniques can dramatically reduce model size and inference costs while maintaining accuracy.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/compress-ml-models-for-inference"},{"id":"catalog/architecture/scale-logical-components-independently","title":"Scale logical components independently","description":"Description","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/scale-logical-components-independently"},{"id":"catalog/architecture/right-hardware-type","title":"Select the right hardware/VM instance types for AI/ML training","description":"Selecting the right hardware/VM instance types for AI/ML training and inference is critical for energy efficiency.

Adding more resources to support increased traffic requirements introduces more embodied carbon and more demand for electricity. Continuing to handle all requests during high carbon intensity will increase overall emissions for your system. Shedding traffic that is lower priority during these scenarios will save on resources and carbon emissions. This approach requires an understanding of your traffic, including which call requests are critical and which can best withstand retry attempts and failures.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/requirements/shed-lower-priority-traffic"},{"id":"catalog/development/evaluate-whether-to-use-TLS-termination","title":"Terminate TLS at border gateway","description":"Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures that all data passed between the web server and web browsers remain private and encrypted.
