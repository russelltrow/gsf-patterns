Scaling infrastructure dynamically based on actual demand eliminates excess capacity and improves efficiency.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/operations/dynamic-scaling-based-on-demand"},{"id":"catalog/requirements/encrypt-what-is-necessary","title":"Encrypt what is necessary","description":"Data protection through encryption is a crucial aspect of our security measures.

State includes the data structures and member variables that the service reads and writes. Depending on how the service is architected, the state might also include files or other resources stored on the disk. Applications that consume large memory or on-disk data require larger VM sizes, especially for cloud computing where you would need larger VM SKUs to support high RAM capacity and multiple data disks.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/implement-stateless-design"},{"id":"catalog/requirements/match-slo","title":"Match your service level objectives to business needs","description":"If service downtimes are acceptable it\'s better to not strive for highest availability but to design the solution according to real business needs. Lower availability guarantees can help reduce energy consumption by using less infrastructure components.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/requirements/match-slo"},{"id":"catalog/development/minimizing-deployed-environments","title":"Minimize the total number of deployed environments","description":"In a given application, there may be a need to utilize multiple environments in the application workflow. Typically, a development environment is used for regular updates, while staging or testing enviroments are used to make sure there are no issues before code reaches a production environment where users may have access. Each added environment has an increasing energy impact, which in turn creates more emissions. As such, it is important to understand the necessity of each enviroment and it\'s environmental impact.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/development/minimizing-deployed-environments"},{"id":"catalog/development/minimize-transmitted-data","title":"Minimize transmitted data size","description":"From an energy-efficiency perspective, it\'s better to minimize the size of the data transmitted so that less energy is required because the network traffic is reduced.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/development/minimize-transmitted-data"},{"id":"catalog/operations/optimize-cpu-utilization","title":"Optimize CPU utilization","description":"CPU usage and utilization varies throughout the day, sometimes wildly for different computational requirements.

Two servers running at low utilization rates will consume more energy than one running at a high utilization rate. In addition, the unused capacity on the underutilized server could be more efficiently used for another task or process.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/operations/right-size-compute-resources"},{"id":"catalog/operations/scale-down-applications-when-not-in-use","title":"Scale down applications when not in use","description":"Applications consume CPU even when they are not actively in use.
