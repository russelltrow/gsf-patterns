State includes the data structures and member variables that the service reads and writes. Depending on how the service is architected, the state might also include files or other resources stored on the disk. Applications that consume large memory or on-disk data require larger VM sizes, especially for cloud computing where you would need larger VM SKUs to support high RAM capacity and multiple data disks.","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/implement-stateless-design"},{"id":"catalog/architecture/reduce-network-traversal-between-VMs","title":"Reduce network traversal between VMs","description":"Description","permalink":"/gsf-patterns/catalog/architecture/reduce-network-traversal-between-VMs"},{"id":"catalog/operations/scale-down-applications-when-not-in-use","title":"Scale down applications when not in use","description":"Applications consume CPU even when they are not actively in use.
