# Green Software Patterns Catalog

## Pattern Categories

### [Requirements](/catalog/requirements/)
**4 patterns** | Define

Set the right expectations from the start. These patterns help you define what "good enough" looks like for your software - balancing business needs, user experience, and environmental impact. Make intentional choices about security, performance, and quality before you build, ensuring you don't over-engineer or under-deliver.

**Key topics:** Encryption scope, service level objectives, customer device impact, traffic prioritization

---

### [Architecture](/catalog/architecture/)
**14 patterns** | Architect

Make structural decisions that multiply efficiency. Choose how your system is built - where it runs, how components communicate, which technologies power it. These foundational choices ripple through everything that follows, determining whether your software will be nimble and efficient or bloated and wasteful.

**Key topics:** AI/ML systems, containerization, serverless computing, region selection, network design, compute architectures

---

### [Development](/catalog/development/)
**21 patterns** | Build

Write code that does more with less. From choosing efficient languages and frameworks to optimizing data handling and media assets, these patterns help you build software that's fast, lean, and resource-conscious. Make every line of code earn its place.

**Key topics:** Web optimization, asset delivery, caching strategies, compression, API design, rendering techniques, data transmission

---

### [Operations](/catalog/operations/)
**11 patterns** | Operate

Run only what you need, when you need it. Scale infrastructure to match actual demand, eliminate idle resources, and automate efficiency into your daily operations. Transform your runtime from a constant drain into a flexible, responsive system that adapts to real-world usage.

**Key topics:** Resource right-sizing, dynamic scaling, storage optimization, security hardening, workload scheduling
